<p>‚ÄúHi, may I please speak with [proband/parent‚Äôs name]?  My name is <strong>__</strong><strong><em>, I am calling from the University of Pennsylvania. 
I am calling from the University of Pennsylvania where __</em></strong> participated in the first timepoint of our research MRI study. We are now calling to recruit for our second timepoint and were hoping that you would be interested in coming in! The second timepoint would involved one, 4-6 hour visit to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and we would complete many of the same activities as the first timepoint including memory and puzzle like games on the computer, self-report questionnaires, and the 1-hour MRI scan. You would be compensated $150 fro all activities and You/your child will also be reimbursed for any travel costs (transportation and parking). Does that sound like something you would be interested in?‚Äù</p>

<p>If they are interested, parents must complete the Fullscreen (on Oracle) and the MRI screener again to confirm their child‚Äôs eligibility.</p>

<p>Thank you for volunteering for our research study! Please find information about your study visit below: 
Visit: Wednesday, February XXth at 8:30AM.
I will meet you in the main lobby of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, located at 3400 Spruce Street. Information about parking can be found here. The visits will take around 4-5 hours. We ask that you bring their social security number to the visit, so that we can get them re-registered in our payment system. 
I will also be calling you 1-week and 24-hours before the visit to go through final COVID-19 screening questions. Additionally, please make sure that only one legal guardian accompanies them to the visit (no other siblings or people will be allowed in the hospital). Final reminder, that masks must be worn inside the hospital at all times. 
Thanks again for volunteering!  If you have any questions, you can reach me by email or phone at Xxxx.
