<p>GUID are Global Unique Identifiers used in the National Data Archive. In order to complete data sharing for NIMH, each study participant will need a GUID made.</p>

<p>First, you will need to request an NDA account. Once you have logged in to your profile, click on the Tools menu, and select GUID tool.

If a subject has no middle name, leave the column blank and fill in NO for the column SUBJECTHASMIDDLENAME.</p>

<p>If the document validates with no errors, generate GUIDS and save on Saturn. The GUIDs can be uploaded to Oracle, so that they auto populate in Tableau, or other data sources.</p>
