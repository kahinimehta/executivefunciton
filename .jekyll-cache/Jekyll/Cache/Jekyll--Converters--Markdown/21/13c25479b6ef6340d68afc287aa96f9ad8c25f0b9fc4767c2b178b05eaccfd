  <li>Log into PennBox (or the Box with your PennKey), and move the log_file into timepoint1/2 under the Variability tasks. Also move the log file into the correct folder on the EF laptop, i.e: TIMEPOINT1 or TIMEPOINT2</li>
  <li>Troubleshooting: [in case of error]
    <ul>
      <li>Disconnect and reconnect the variability apparatus and start again</li>
      <li>Make sure the log file is not within the “TIMEPOINT 1” or “TIMEPOINT 2” folders</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="self-report-questionnaire-administration">Self-Report Questionnaire Administration</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Note: Both child and parent will be completing self report questionnaires. The proband scales are 3 surveys, the child will be more depending on the timepoint how many</li>
  <li>Navigate to RedCap at the link <a href="https://axis.med.upenn.edu/">here</a>, sign in with your RedCap credentials and select project titled: “Common Self Report Scales #collection”</li>
  <li>Click “Add/Edit Records” on the left side panel and enter the BBL ID and select the scales with the Redcap ID that you generated through oracle</li>
  <li>
    <p>Fill out the Scales Admin page and click save and go to next form. On Scales Instructions, select “logout + Open Survey” on the top left of the screen (screenshot below) and you will review instructions verbatim with participants. (see additional notes on how to administer below)
<img src="/executivefunction/assets/images/EF34.png" alt="Scales instructions" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If participants don’t have any questions, you can click “submit” and the participant will move through the self-report scales, survey to survey until they are finished. Then they will get the below screen.
<img src="/executivefunction/assets/images/EF35.png" alt="STOP" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will then need to enter a validation code. Please also enter any notes fields you see fit. If you select any validation code other than “valid”, you must include notes as to what led to your selection.
<img src="/executivefunction/assets/images/EF36.png" alt="Validation" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>If you click past this (or the participant does) you are able to enter the validation code “offline” as well by going into the record at a later time and clicking into the form “Scales Validation”.
<img src="/executivefunction/assets/images/EF37.png" alt="Validation post survey" /></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Miscellaneous but important notes:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>During instructions page, please reiterate to the participant that they should try to answer each question and take their best guess if they’re unsure, and that they are able to skip any questions they do not feel comfortable answering.</li>
  <li>Don’t forget to give collateral the 3 short questionnaires to fill out about the proband, preferably during a time when they are not with the proband</li>
  <li>Remind participant to ask the coordinator if they have any questions about any of the questionnaires or items.</li>
  <li>For participants under the age of 18, we stay in the room so we’re close by for questions. For very young children (e.g., younger than 10) you will likely want to proctor the scales administration (i.e., read each question aloud - specify that in the notes section). For older participants (i.e., 18 and older) it’s OK to tell the participant you’ll wait outside and are nearby if they have questions.</li>
  <li>You should make a REDCap report so you can follow along when the forms are marked as complete (please reach out to the CRM so they can show you how to create this if one is not already created). This is to ensure 1) they are moving along and not stuck 2) that they are attentively answering questions and not distracted3) they’re not just clicking the same answer over and over just to get it done.</li>
</ul>

<ol class="no_toc">
  <li><strong>Practice task: [duration = 3-5 min.]:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Using the EF small black HP laptop, go through the practice N-Back task that they will encounter during the scan
Note: This must be completed prior to the scan</li>
      <li>EF Black PC Laptop → enter common password → click on EFR01 (the presentation) on the desktop → Click run scenario or run non-stop</li>
      <li>You will see a page that says “Ready” – Press enter to continue</li>
      <li>The instructions for the 0-Back will appear → read the instructions below, press the Space Bar to continue to 2-back → After you have completed giving the instructions press “ESC” → “Continue” → “Run non-stop” to begin the task
<em>Instructions: “This is the n-back fractal task that you will play during the scan. In the scanner, you will have a screen that shows the task and a remote that you will hold in your dominant hand throughout the scan. In the actual scan, you will press the left blue button to respond, for right now, we will practice with you pressing the ‘B’ button on the computer keyboard. The test has two parts, we’ll practice both parts. The first part is the 0-back. Press the “B” button as fast as you can whenever you see this purple picture (point to picture). Do you have any questions about the 0-back? Great! The second part is the 2-back, press the “B” button as fast as you can whenever the picture you see is the same as the one that came two before, or two-back. You can see in this example, there is the fire picture, stripped picture, then the fire picture again. You’d press the button when you see the last fire picture because it’s the same as the one that came two before or two back (pointing throughout). Any questions before we begin the practice? Great!”</em>
<em>Observe practice to ensure they understand. Repeat if they do not seem to understand.</em></li>

  <li><strong>Radiology Check-In: [duration = 10-20 min.]</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>20-30 minutes before the scheduled scan time escort participant and collateral to radiology for them to be checked in (good time for participant to use the bathroom at radiology)
<em>Note: Parent/legal guardian is needed to sign necessary consent information at Radiology</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Pre-Scan Self Reports: [duration = 5 min.]</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>On RedCAP, the second set of self-reports generated from oracle will have 2 short surveys to be completed either at HUP6 or right before you go down to radiology (see notes above on axis self-report generation and administration)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><em>Instructions: The first survey is about how you feel right now, in this moment, about to get in the scanner. Fill in the bubbles and press submit when you are finished. This will take you to a second survey. When finished, hit submit and tell me you’re done.</em></p>
