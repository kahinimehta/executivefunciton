<p>Participants will be recruited using screening mechanisms provided by LiBI (CHOP IRB  #16-013305), a research institute that spans both CHOP and Penn.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Target: 180 adolescents, including 65 with ADHD and 65 with PS, as well as 50 typically-developing comparators</li>
  <li>Patients will be drawn from two clinical groups with well-documented executive deficits: ADHD and PS.  Both patient groups and typically-developing comparators will be matched on age, sex, and race.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Key Inclusion Criteria</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Age: 8-15</li>
  <li>Sex: Males and Females</li>
  <li><em>Patients (n=130)</em>: 
   Each participant will meet diagnostic criteria for either ADHD or PS (see Assessment, below).  Given known and substantial co-morbidity between PS and ADHD (i.e., approx. 30% in the PNC), co-morbidity will be allowed and accounted for in specificity analyses. Youth meeting criteria for both PS and ADHD will be considered PS for enrollment purposes.</li>
  <li><em>Typically developing (n=50)</em>: 
   No current or lifetime history of any DSM-V diagnosis or substance use disorder.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Key Exclusion Criteria</em>:</p>

  <li>Significant medical or neurological illness that impacts brain function or impedes participation</li>
