    "content": "# Flywheel SDK ## Requirements This upload requires: * A local installation of [Python](https://pennlinc.github.io/docs/Basics/python/) * [Logging in](https://pennlinc.github.io/docs/flywheel) to Flywheel using the CLI * A directory of files to upload to Flywheel * A .tsv of SCANID's and BBLID's (optional) ## Getting started We will be uploading files using the [flywheel-SDK](https://flywheel-io.gitlab.io/product/backend/sdk/branches/master/python/getting_started.html). To get started, import necessary packages and log in using the CLI. ```python import glob import flywheel fw = flywheel.Client() ``` Set project using its name on flywheel ```python EFProj=fw.projects.find_first('label=EFR01') print(EFProj) ``` Set your directory to location of files for upload and list out files. ```python root_dir = '/Users/krmurtha/Box Sync/EXECUTIVE_FUNCTION/SCANNER_TASK/' bids_dir = 'BIDS/test' all_files=glob.glob(root_dir + bids_dir + '*/*') ``` ## Upload to Session level of Flywheel To upload to the session or scan level (ie: BIDS files, .zip file of Variability Tasks), iterate through subjects and sessions to access session containers, then pick the corresponding file that matches the session label and upload. In this example, we use the BIDS file name in a task file to match each .tsv with the appropriate session on flywheel. ```python subjects=EFProj.subjects() #access all subjects in given project sessions=[] for s in subjects : #loop through subs and access all sessions in a given project tempsessions=s.sessions() sessions.extend(tempsessions) for ses in sessions: #loop through sessions and save scan id scanid=ses.label for file in all_files: f=file.split('/') g=(f[len(f)-1]).split('_') h=(g[1].split('-'))[1] if scanid == h: #match session id to scan id in the file to be uploaded: print(\"uploading {0} to {1}\".format(file, scanid)) ses.upload_file(file) ``` ## Upload to the Acquisition level of Flywheel To upload to the acquisition or sequence level (ie: raw .log files or PMU associated with a specific acquisition), iterate through sessions and acquisitions to select the acquisition label you are looking for, then pick the corresponding file that matches the session label and upload. For this example, we use scanner task .log files that are uploaded directly to the fracback acquisition, using a .csv of scan id's and bbl id's from oracle. ```python ids=pd.read_csv('EFR01DataEntryTracke-Eft1scanID_DATA_2021-09-15_1520.csv') id_dict=dict(zip(ids.bblid, ids.scan_id_timepoint_1)) for ses in sessions: #loop through sessions and save scan id sesid=ses.label acq=ses.acquisitions() for a in acq: #loop through acquisitions for each session EFFiles=a.files #access all files attatched to a session (ie: nifti, dicom) EFTypes=[x.type for x in EFFiles] #identify type of file for file in to_upload1: f=(file.split('/')) bblid=f[len(f)-2] scanid = id_dict[int(bblid)] #search for correct label and file type in acquisition, and match session id to scan id in the file to be uploaded: if 'ABCD_fMRI_frac-no-back-run1' in a.label or 'func_task-fracnoback_run-02' in a.label and 'nifti' in EFTypes and int(sesid) == scanid: print('uploading {0} to {1}'.format(file, scanid)) a.upload_file(file) ``` ",

Scheduling Email Template (to assessors) {: .no_toc } #### **1. Recruitment Call script**: Hi, am I speaking with XX’s parent? My name is XX, calling from the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. We would like to invite your XX to participate in a paid research study with us. If you’re interested, do you have some time right now to talk about it? [No] No worries. Would you mind explaining why this isn’t of interest to you? (Log in contact notes) Thank you for your time, have a nice day/night! [Why my child?] This was a randomly generated list from CHOP. [Yes] Our study examines how the brain changes and develops over time. It would be a two-part study. The first part involves an interview with [for participants aged 8-10] you [for participants aged 11-15] you and your child as well as some computerized games for your child. This part we’d be offering virtually so you could do it with a Zoom link from the comfort of your own home. The interview would take around 2-4 hours, depending on how much you’d be willing to share with us. The computerized games would take around 1.5 hours, and because we offer both online we’d be flexible with splitting up and [for participants aged 11-15] doing the interviews at the same time so it would take less overall time for your family. We’d be compensating $80 for this, payable via ClinCard, which is our version of a debit card, and you’d use it the exact same way. The second part of the study would involve you and your child visiting the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania for an MRI scan. The entire visit would take 4-5 hours as it would also involve some more computerized games and self-reports about your child’s mood and experiences, but your child would only be in the scanner for one hour. You would be compensated $100 for this, and reimbursed for travel and parking via ClinCard. In 1.5 years, we’d follow up with you and have you come in for another scan day, but for right now, it’s just the interview, the computerized games, and the first MRI visit. Does this sound interesting? [No] No worries. Would you mind explaining why this isn’t of interest to you? (Log in contact notes) Thank you for your time, have a nice day/night! [Yes] Thank you … [continue into next steps, see “Recruitment Call” section below] #### **2. Voicemail template**: Hi, my name is XX from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

Recruitment Email Template (for potential parents)**: The Lifespan Brain Institute (LiBI) of CHOP and UPenn would like to invite you and your child to participate in a paid research study. Our LiBI researchers hope to learn more about how the brain grows and develops over time, and how those changes relate to the way that children think and solve problems. First, eligible participants will complete an interview, computer tasks, and a few questionnaires, which can be performed virtually or in person, depending on your preference. For children under age 18, a parent or guardian will also be interviewed. This visit usually lasts around 3 hours, and participants will be paid $80. After your interview, we will ask you and your child to come to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania for an MRI brain scan and some additional computer tasks. For this visit, participants will be paid $100, and will be reimbursed for any travel and parking expenses. This visit typically lasts around 4 hours. We will ask you and your child to complete these measures 2-3 times over the course of a 5-year longitudinal research study, in 18-month intervals. Here is the video cartoon of the research MRI if you would like to play it for your child to help them better understand the study!

The second timepoint would involved one, 4-6 hour visit to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and we would complete many of the same activities as the first timepoint including memory and puzzle like games on the computer, self-report questionnaires, and the 1-hour MRI scan. You would be compensated $150 fro all activities and You/your child will also be reimbursed for any travel costs (transportation and parking). Does that sound like something you would be interested in?” If they are interested, parents must complete the Fullscreen (on Oracle) and the MRI screener again to confirm their child’s eligibility. ### Appointment Scheduling - **MRI Scheduling** : 1. Navigate to the CAMRIS UPenn Calendar – ([https://pathbio.med.upenn.edu/camris/dogfish/](https://pathbio.med.upenn.edu/camris/dogfish/)) and sign in with your Penn credentials → click “HUP 6 \"FNDBAMR2\" (3T PRISMA-VE11)” 2. Because EF has Category 1 Status you may schedule 3 months out, however, you must fill in the order # from PennChart to prove you have a participant scheduled within 24 hours of reserving the slot (these are the current guidelines, subject to change – David Roalf is point person for image acquisition related questions) 3. Navigate to Appointments Plus and review the schedule of the coordinator you would like to assign to the visit 4. When you find a slot on HUP6 that aligns with assessor and participant availability click the open slot on CAMRIS to reserve your slot (_note: the MRI slot can be done at any point within the 4-6 hour visit, however, make sure to allow yourself enough time from participants arrival for consents, MRI screener form, practice task, radiology check, pre-scan self-reports – I usually leave at least 1 hour but this is up to assessor’s discretion_) 5. Select the protocol you are scheduling for (829744) 6. Enter “EF 32ch” in the “Title” field 7. Click create and the box will turn green (within 24 hours of scheduling, you must go back and fill in the order #).

Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting-edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 180 participants ages 8-18. This sample will include 65 with ADHD, 65 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 50 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence.

    "title": "NDAR Imaging Upload",
    "content": "# NDAR Uploading images to NDA requires a formatted spreadsheet of including information from the JSON and the file-path to NIFTI images. Using an exported BIDS dataset and PyBIDS tools, you can download and format all images from a Flywheel project for NDA upload. For periodic uploads, only T1 data is required. ​ In addition to a BIDS-valid dataset, either on disk or on Flywheel, you will need Demographics information pulled from Tableau, including including BBLID, SCANID, NDAR-GUID, Date of Scan, Sex, Age at Scan (in months), and Visit Number. ​ If using data hosted on Flywheel, start by exporting to a cluster or external hard drive using the [/Flywheel CLI](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360008224733-Exporting-a-BIDS-Project-using-the-CLI) and the command `fw export bids -p \"PROJECT_NAME\" ~/path/to/directory/BIDS`. If only sharing anatomical data (ie: T1w, T2w) use the `--data-type anat` call to specify. Otherwise download all data-types that are required to share. ​ Next, using PyBIDS/NiBABLE parse to parse file names into a CSV file of relevant information (ie: subject and session labels, data type, file name, and other imaging parameters) as follows: ​ ``` R pip install bids from bids import BIDSLayout from bids.layout import parse_file_entities import glob import pandas as pd import nibabel as nb import json ​ #set root_dir as the directory where the BIDS directory is saved, and bids_dir to the BIDS directory root_dir = '/path/to/directory' bids_dir = '/BIDS' # make a list of all images in the BIDS directory all_files=glob.glob(root_dir + bids_dir + '**/**/**/**/*') #filter out jsons, as we only need niftis all_niftis=[] for file in all_files: if 'json' not in file: all_niftis.append(file) #length of list should be the same as # of scans print(len(all_niftis)) ​ #initialize list scans = [] #for each file in the list, parse the information into a dictionary, add the filename + path key value pair, as well as other fields from the NIFTIS and add it to the list we just initialized ​ for file in all_niftis: img = img = nb.load(file) #obliquity = np.any(nb.affines.obliquity(img.affine) #> 1e-4) voxel_sizes = img.header.get_zooms() matrix_dims = img.shape result = parse_file_entities(file) result['filename']=file result[\"VoxelSizeDim1\"] = float(voxel_sizes[0]) result[\"VoxelSizeDim3\"] = float(voxel_sizes[2]) result[\"VoxelSizeDim2\"] = float(voxel_sizes[1]) result['acquisitionmatrix']=matrix_dims result[\"Dim1Size\"] = matrix_dims[0] result[\"Dim2Size\"] = matrix_dims[1] result[\"Dim3Size\"] = matrix_dims[2] ​ scans.append(result) #and convert to a dataframe and save df = pd.DataFrame(scans) df.to_csv('nda_scans.csv', sep=',') ``` You will also need to get information on the version of dcm2nii used to convert each scan. To do this, we can use an SDK script. ​ ```R import pandas as pd import flywheel fw = flywheel.Client() ​ #select the Flywheel project you are working on and iterate through all subjects and sessions EFProj=fw.projects.find_first('label=EFRO1') subs= EFProj.subjects() sessions=[] for s in subs : tempsessions=s.sessions() sessions.extend(tempsessions) ​ #create a list of tuples containing session ID + dcm_version versions=[] for r in sessions: #print(r.label) acq=r.acquisitions() #print(acq) for a in acq: a = fw.get(a.id) #print(a.info.keys()) files=a.files types=[x.type for x in files] for fi in files: if 'T1w' in a.label and 'setter' not in a.label and 'nifti' in fi.type: #print(a.label) #print(fi.name) #print(fi.info.items()) dcm_info=fi['info'].get('ConversionSoftwareVersion',None) #dict[r.label]=fi.info.items versions.append((r.label, 'dcm2niix', dcm_info)) #convert to dataframe and save as a .CSV df=pd.DataFrame(versions) df.columns = ['a', 'b', 'c'] df.to_csv('EF_dcm_version.csv', sep=',') ``` Finally, use R to read in the image03 template and format the information from Flywheel along with demographics from tableau to NDA specifications. Step through code, paying close attention to values that may need to be changed for specific protocols. Currently, the example included in the code is for BBL ABCD protocols (EF, Motive, etc) but may need to be changed based on specifications included in CAMRIS protocol (ie: TE in line 54, TR in line 51, or lines that assign different values for different scan types (ie: T1 vs T2 scans). ​ ```R library(dplyr) library(tidyr) library(naniar) library(car) ​ setwd('~/Desktop/informatics/ndar') #import the parsed file information from the bids directory nda_scans% unite('dcm_ver', b:c, remove=FALSE) ​ ​ # merge BIDS info, dcm_ver and scan data into one sheet data% rename(subjectkey = data.guid) image03$src_subject_id<-data$bblid image03$interview_date<- data$doscan image03$interview_age<- data$scanagemonths image03$sex<- data$sex #keep Scan ID saved as comments image03$comments_misc<- data$session image03$image_file<- data$filename #using this as a place holder at the moment image03$image_thumbnail_file<-\"\" image03$image_description<- \"MRI\" image03$experiment_id<- \"\" image03$scan_type<-data$suffix #recode based on NIH dictionary image03$scan_type[ image03$scan_type == 'T1w' ]<-'MR structural (T1)' image03$scan_type[ image03$scan_type == 'T2w' ]<-'MR structural (T2)' image03$scan_object<- \"Live\" image03$image_file_format<- \"NIFTI\" image03$data_file2<- \"\" image03$data_file2_type<-\"\" image03$image_modality<- \"MRI\" image03$scanner_manufacturer_pd<- \"SIEMENS\" image03$scanner_type_pd<- \"MAGNETOM Prisma_fit\" image03$scanner_software_versions_pd<-'VE11C' image03$magnetic_field_strength<-\"3T\" #mri_repetition_time_pd for EF: T1= 2.5, for T2=3.2 image03$mri_repetition_time_pd[ image03$scan_type == 'MR structural (T1)' ]<-2.5 image03$mri_repetition_time_pd[ image03$scan_type == 'MR structural (T2)' ]<-3.2 #mri_echo_time_pd for T1=2.9 ms , for T2= 565 ms image03$mri_echo_time_pd[ image03$scan_type == 'MR structural (T1)' ]<-0.0029 image03$mri_echo_time_pd[ image03$scan_type == 'MR structural (T2)' ]<-0.565 #flip_angle for T1=8.0 deg, T2=missing? image03$flip_angle[ image03$scan_type == 'MR structural (T1)' ]<-'8.0 deg' image03$flip_angle[ image03$scan_type == 'MR structural (T2)' ]<-'120.0 deg' #acquisition_matrix image03$acquisition_matrix<-data$acquisitionmatrix #mri_field_of_view_pd (dim1 x voxelsize1, dim2 x voxelsize2, dim3 x voxelsize3) or the same as acquisition matrix image03$mri_field_of_view_pd<-data$acquisitionmatrix #patient_position is L0.0 A20.0 F30.0 mm for both image03$patient_position<-'L0.0 A20.0 F30.0 mm' #photomet_interpret image03$photomet_interpret<- 'grayscale' image03$receive_coil<- '' image03$transmit_coil<- '' image03$transformation_performed<-'No' image03$transformation_type<-'' image03$image_history<-'' image03$image_num_dimensions<-3 image03$image_extent1<-data$Dim1Size image03$image_extent2<-data$Dim2Size image03$image_extent3<-data$Dim3Size image03$image_extent4<-'' image03$extent4_type<-'' image03$image_extent5<-'' image03$extent5_type<-'' image03$image_unit1<-'Millimeters' image03$image_unit2<-'Millimeters' image03$image_unit3<-'Millimeters' image03$image_unit4<-'' image03$image_unit5<-'' image03$image_resolution1<-data$VoxelSizeDim1 image03$image_resolution2<-data$VoxelSizeDim2 image03$image_resolution3<-data$VoxelSizeDim3 image03$image_resolution4<-'' image03$image_resolution5<-'' image03$image_slice_thickness<-'1.00' image03$image_orientation<-'Sagittal' image03$qc_outcome<-'' image03$qc_description<-'' image03$qc_fail_quest_reason<-'' image03$decay_correction<-'' image03$frame_end_times<-'' image03$frame_end_unit<-'' image03$frame_start_times<-'' image03$frame_start_unit<-'' image03$pet_isotope<-'' image03$pet_tracer<-'' image03$time_diff_inject_to_image<-'' image03$time_diff_units<-'' image03$pulse_seq<-'' image03$slice_acquisition<-'' image03$software_preproc<-data$dcm_ver image03$study<-'' image03$week<-'' image03$experiment_description<-'' image03$visit<-data$timepoints #recode to NIH dictionary image03$visit[ image03$visit == '1' ]<-'baseline' image03$visit[ image03$visit == '2' ]<-'followup' image03$slice_timing<-'' image03$bvek_bval_files<-'' image03$bvecfile<-'' image03$bvalfile<-'' image03$deviceserialnumber<-'' image03$procdate<-'' image03$visnum<-data$timepoints # there are more fields that need to be calculated, but they are empty (conditional on other modalities) ​ write.csv(image03, file='image03_NDA.csv') ``` Once you write out the .csv, copy/paste the data into the original template from NIH, and the rest of the fields will generate blank.

    "content": "# Procedure The study involves several segments, the procedures for which are addressed separately here. All participants will complete parts 2 and 3 during two separate time-points, while participants who enroll in the first half of the project period will be able to complete an additional third session (also comprised of parts 2 and 3 below). 1. Following pre-screening subjects will receive a reminder call 1 week and 1 day before the appointment, as well as a reminder email or letter. 2. Standard Psychiatric and Cognitive Assessment Assessment: All subjects will receive detailed assessments to comprehensively evaluate EF capacity in the context of psychiatric diagnosis and document functioning in other cognitive domains. Assessment of youths and collateral information from parents will take place in a single 3-5 hour visit that will be performed within 1 month of neuroimaging. Informed written consent will be obtained from the parent/guardian of the participant, and assent will be obtained from the participant. We will be collecting consent and administering a portion of study procedures electronically, over the phone, or using BlueJeans or similar HIPAA-compliant, IRB and University approved teleconferencing systems. - Assessment of EF using a battery of tasks - Multi-domain assessment of cognition: Beyond measures of EF, all participants will complete the Penn CNB. - Clinical diagnostic assessment: All subjects will receive a detailed diagnostic assessment from highly-trained assessors using a computerized version of the K-SADS interview. As in our prior work, prodromal symptoms of psychosis will be assessed using Structured Interview for Prodromal Symptoms. Furthermore, the Scale of Prodromal Symptoms (SOPS) will be administered along with the SIPS; the SOPS rates the severity of prodromal, psychotic, and other symptoms occurring within the past 6 months. 3. Neuroimaging Protocol The imaging visit lasts approximately 4-5 hours. All subjects will undergo longitudinal neuroimaging as part of this study. Images will be acquired in a one-hour session using a research-dedicated 3T Siemens Prisma Scanner. All sequences will be harmonized with the landmark Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, to facilitate data pooling and sharing. - Sequences acquired will include T1 and T2 sequences to assess brain structure, diffusion imaging for structural tractography, and fMRI to measure EF activation, functional connectivity, and task-based functional dynamics. As in ABCD, intrinsic connectivity scanning will be broken into four brief (~5 min) runs to reduce in-scanner motion. - Prior to scanning, a practice task may be conducted inside a mock scanner environment, which acclimatizes participants to the environment and minimizes novelty effects. Preparation for MRI: A brief (5 min) practice task will be conducted inside a decommissioned MRI scanner as part of a mock-scanning session in order to ensure all subjects understand and can perform the task, as well as to acclimatize the subjects, reducing novelty and anxiety responses inside the scanner. Participants will then be prepared for scanning by the investigator and the MRI technician. After assessing state anxiety and mood symptoms, subjects will be placed supine in the scanner, wearing earplugs to muffle noise. - Structural and functional scans will be obtained in a single session on a clinically-approved 3 Tesla Siemens Prisma (Erlangen, Germany) scanner, equipped with 80mT/m gradients and 200 mT/m/s slew-rates. RF transmission will use a quadrature body-coil, and reception will use a Siemens receive-only 64-channel head coil. The total time in the scanner will be approximately 1 hour. 4. In addition to scanning, participants may also complete self-report questionnaires and decision-making tasks, outlined below. We will be administering a portion these study procedures electronically, over the phone, or using BlueJeans or similar HIPAA-compliant, IRB and University approved teleconferencing systems. 5. There will also be additional symptom assessments and decision making batteries administered. ",

Print paper screener which can be found here: afp://Saturn/Coordinators/Protocols/TED_PROTOCOLS/EXECUTIVE_829744/subjectFolder/mri/ Generic_MRI_metal_screen_UPDATE 2. Ask parent to complete the form and sign **NOTE: when you get down to the scanner have MRI Technologist review the form and sign at the bottom** ### Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB) _Refer to Lisa D'Errico for specific directions on administration of CNB’s (in person or remote)_ Note: for timepoint 1 you will be completing LiBI CNB on CAPA-day and only EXECTS CNB on scan-day. For T2/T3 you will complete BOTH LiBI and EXECTS **EF-Specific Set-Up** - Timepoint 1: Administer the EXECTS CNB with EXECTS site ID. Full LiBI CNB is administered on intake day under LiBI site ID. BBLID = SUBID. - Timepoint 2/3: Administer EXECTS CNB with EXECTS site ID, and LIBI CNB with EXECTS site ID. - For in-person assessments, navigate to [https://webcnp.med.upenn.edu/](https://webcnp.med.upenn.edu/) then select “Administer WebCNP Battery” and you will be prompted to sign in - For virtual assessments, refer to the guides and site-mapping specs in the Coordinators channel. The LiBI battery on T2 can be administered virtually, but the EF CNB must always be administered in person. - Fill in the remaining fields as well as the following page which asks about DOB, education, sex, handedness **Reminder: as per CNB training remember to go back to “validate session” and fill in any notes on the assessment** ### Variability 1. On the EF laptop, enter the common password, go to the IIV battery folder on the desktop 2. Go to log_files and create a new folder outside “TIMEPOINT1” and “TIMEPOINT2”: BBLID for T1, BBLID_SCANID for T2 3. Attach the EF console to the computer via the wire 4. Click on the presentation file for the IIV battery, and then when it opens up, go to “Scenario”. In the sidebar, navigate to the folder you just created, and click the “ 5. If participants don’t have any questions, you can click “submit” and the participant will move through the self-report scales, survey to survey until they are finished. Then they will get the below screen. 6. You will then need to enter a validation code. Please also enter any notes fields you see fit. If you select any validation code other than “valid”, you must include notes as to what led to your selection. 7. If you click past this (or the participant does) you are able to enter the validation code “offline” as well by going into the record at a later time and clicking into the form “Scales Validation”. *Miscellaneous but important notes:* - During instructions page, please reiterate to the participant that they should try to answer each question and take their best guess if they’re unsure, and that they are able to skip any questions they do not feel comfortable answering. - Don’t forget to give collateral the 3 short questionnaires to fill out about the proband, preferably during a time when they are not with the proband - Remind participant to ask the coordinator if they have any questions about any of the questionnaires or items. - For participants under the age of 18, we stay in the room so we’re close by for questions. For very young children (e.g., younger than 10) you will likely want to proctor the scales administration (i.e., read each question aloud - specify that in the notes section). For older participants (i.e., 18 and older) it’s OK to tell the participant you’ll wait outside and are nearby if they have questions. - You should make a REDCap report so you can follow along when the forms are marked as complete (please reach out to the CRM so they can show you how to create this if one is not already created). This is to ensure 1) they are moving along and not stuck 2) that they are attentively answering questions and not distracted3) they’re not just clicking the same answer over and over just to get it done. ## Pre-Scan Items 1. **Practice task: [duration = 3-5 min.]:** - Using the EF small black HP laptop, go through the practice N-Back task that they will encounter during the scan Note: This must be completed prior to the scan - EF Black PC Laptop → enter common password → click on EFR01 (the presentation) on the desktop → Click run scenario or run non-stop - You will see a page that says “Ready” – Press enter to continue - The instructions for the 0-Back will appear → read the instructions below, press the Space Bar to continue to 2-back → After you have completed giving the instructions press “ESC” → “Continue” → “Run non-stop” to begin the task _Instructions: “This is the n-back fractal task that you will play during the scan. In the scanner, you will have a screen that shows the task and a remote that you will hold in your dominant hand throughout the scan. In the actual scan, you will press the left blue button to respond, for right now, we will practice with you pressing the ‘B’ button on the computer keyboard. The test has two parts, we’ll practice both parts. The first part is the 0-back. Press the “B” button as fast as you can whenever you see this purple picture (point to picture). Do you have any questions about the 0-back? Great! The second part is the 2-back, press the “B” button as fast as you can whenever the picture you see is the same as the one that came two before, or two-back. You can see in this example, there is the fire picture, stripped picture, then the fire picture again. You’d press the button when you see the last fire picture because it’s the same as the one that came two before or two back (pointing throughout). Any questions before we begin the practice? Great!”_ *Observe practice to ensure they understand. Repeat if they do not seem to understand.* {: .no_toc } 2. **Radiology Check-In: [duration = 10-20 min.]** - 20-30 minutes before the scheduled scan time escort participant and collateral to radiology for them to be checked in (good time for participant to use the bathroom at radiology) *Note: Parent/legal guardian is needed to sign necessary consent information at Radiology* 3. **Pre-Scan Self Reports: [duration = 5 min.]** - On RedCAP, the second set of self-reports generated from oracle will have 2 short surveys to be completed either at HUP6 or right before you go down to radiology (see notes above on axis self-report generation and administration) _Instructions: The first survey is about how you feel right now, in this moment, about to get in the scanner. Fill in the bubbles and press submit when you are finished. This will take you to a second survey. When finished, hit submit and tell me you’re done._ ## Scan **Prescan setup ~10 minutes** - PROTOCOL NAME: SATTERTHWAITE→ “ABCD_32Channel” - FLYWHEEL: BBLID_SCANID@BBL:EFR01 - In case of glasses: use the tool-kit to fix participant with MRI safe glasses - Information for MRI Tech: 1.

Log into **Shared Computer** Account: meduser Password: meduser1 _Set up Movie_ - Select “EFR01_SubjectFilms” from desktop on shared computer, select movie - or DisneyPlus for Ratatouille - Make sure the long AUX chord is plugged into the shared computer - Power on white connector, (volume=50) and select “reverse L/R” - Set up Crosshair Powerpoint - Select “Crosshairs” from desktop of shared computer, minimize until needed - Make sure the long AUX chord is plugged into the shared computer _Ensure participant is set up comfortably_ - Make sure to remind them to stay very still and keep the 2-button remote in their dominant hand the entire time. Make sure they feel the left blue button which they will be using. - Tell them you will be right outside and will talk to them every few minutes (gage nervousness) **Scan administration ~57 minutes** - Reminder: Sign in to MRI apt on CAMRIS calendar[https://pathbio.med.upenn.edu/camris/dogfish/](https://pathbio.med.upenn.edu/camris/dogfish/) 1. Before T1 navsetter (Series #2 - anat_acq-vnavsetter_T1w) check-in with participant to make sure they are ready and the movie is playing okay – remind them to stay super still – play movie 2. Immediately following the end of T1 (Series #3 - anat_T1) RUN IMSCRIBE (must be completed before Series #6 - DWI) and give IMSCRIBE results to the technologist (see notes on how-to complete IMSCRIBE below): - You can then run the next IMSCRIBE immediately changing the template – needed before first functional task (series #9) 3. Before T2 navsetter (Series #4 - anat_acq-vnavsetter_T2w) pause the movie and check in with participant again, also ask the technologist if there is motion on T1, if yes, repeat T1 and re-run inscribe - Following T2 ask Tech to make sure there is not too much motion - if there is, repeat it. 4. Before DWI (Series #6 - dwi_acq-multishell_dir-AP_dwi) pause the movie and check in with participant. Remind them this is the part where the bed will shake/vibrate but to remain as still as possible and continue to watch the movie - Following DWI confirm that there wasn’t too much motion on DWI, if yes, repeat 5. Before the first functional task (Series #9 - func_task-rest_run-01) pull up the white cross on the far left computer and confirm with participant that they see the cross, tell them to focus on the cross and stay super still 6. Before the frac-back task (Series #10 - func_task_fracnoback_run-02) Switch to the BBL Computer and press “run task.” Click through the instructions using the space bar and confirming participant remembers/understands the instructions. Next, press esc - continue - then “run non-stop” to begin - You will see a black screen - tell the technologist they can begin, and a fractal will appear - You can track to make sure participant is responding looking at the FORP dashboard - when they select a button a light will appear there - Click continue - exit task - save to save the logfiles from the task 7. Before the 3rd functional task (Series #13 - func_task-rest_run-03) switch back to the Shared Computer and pull up the cross - ensure that the participant can see the cross and begin 8. You may check in between ASL and QSM (series 14/15) as needed - cross remains on the scree _Notes on Scanner Motion: Scans are in the order or importance, prioritize repeating T1 and T2 scans if there is motion - even if this means having to cut ASL/QSM at the end_ **Imscribe** - Complete at the end of T1) 1. Right click on desktop and open terminal, type “matlab” in terminal 2. In matlab, type “imscribe” to launch 3. First Imscribe: apply to DTI - Template localizer →T1 (make sure to click “show all files”) - Template FOV → DTI - Target localizer→ latest RT export (if right after T1) OR: mnt → → RTExport_Current → click “name” once to make it sort by the most recent (?) → click the particpants name → select 176 images from “series 4” - Note: if sequences run in different order or sequence repeated, the series number will no longer be 4 and will be different. Key is to look for the 176 images 4. Second Imscribe after T1: apply to Rest_Bold, FracBack, other Rest_Bold - Template localizer→ stays the same as above - Template FOV→ BOLD - Select “reuse xForm” on the top right to re-use the T1 scans from above ### MRI Cleanup 1. Sign out of CAMRIS calendar 2. Collect frac_back logfiles (2 files) from BBL_computer by uploading to Pennbox 3. Ensure data has appeared on Flywheel 4. Sign out/close all windows used on computer 5. Remind Technologist about CD/neuroradiology read **GRAB CD from previous visit if you have not already** ### Final Visit Procedures 1. Post-Scan Self Reports: Completed post-scan self reports on Axis (one survey about how they feel right then in that moment) immediately following the scan 2. W9/C2: Make sure participant signs W9 and C2, and participant rather than parent writes the name 3. Payments: Give participant the Clincard [https://clincard.com/](https://clincard.com/) and load payment ($100 for EFT1, $150 for T2, $150 + $150 BONUS at T3) *Escort the participant back to the main lobby, thank them!! and remind them to send you pictures of receipts for travel (must have total amount and the date)* ",
