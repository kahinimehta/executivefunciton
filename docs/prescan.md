2. Say “I’d like to schedule an MRI for research”
3. Provide patient: (a) MRN, (b) Date of Birth, (c) height/weight
Note: participant MRN’s can be found on Saturn, titled “MRN2020NEW_3” (Saturn/Coordinators/Protocols/TED_PROTOCOLS/EXECUTIVE_829744/NewMRNs)
Location: HUP6 (Founders Basement 2, FNDBAMR2), date/time of scan
4. Go through medical screener again
5. For T1→ ask to put in demographic information and supply information about parents, address, race, ethnicity, preferred language
Note: make sure scan is being billed to research

## Generating Scan ID
1. Log into Oracle and go to “Procedures” on the left-hand side
2. Select: “Procedure Store” → “IMG Store” and fill out the relevant information (see image below) and click save. Record generated procedure ID.
Note: Visit # will be used to indicate whether scan is @ T1/2/3, for timepoint 1 scan visit #=1
Note: click the green check next to BBLID each time to ensure you are selecting the correct BBL

## Generating Self-Reports
*Note: In order to generate SR scales, they must be enrolled in EF (this should have been completed during intake CAPA, if not, see below for study-enroll procedures)*
*Note: For those over 18, no collateral self-reports are required to be generated or administered*
*For issues troubleshooting Redcap contact Sage Rush or Scott Troyan
*Notes on administration in Scan Day section*
1. Log into Oracle and go to “REDCAP_SELFREPORT” on the left-hand side
2. Select: “Subject SelfR Store” and fill out relevant information (see image below)
<img src="/executivefunction/assets/images/EF27.png" alt="SR store">

3. If there is a collateral tied to the subject (and collateral scales) you will enter the collateral ID that is autogenerated on this page at the bottom of the screen. 
4. Select enter and you will receive a “SCALEID” and a “REDCapID”.
    - You can use either one of these IDs to search for the record in REDCap, further explained below.
5. Log into Redcap and go to the self-report scales project (most projects use **Common Self-report Scales #collection**)
6. Click View/Edit record 
    - Under the Data Search box, search for scale session by SCALEID or REDCapID
7. Fill out Scales Admin Page, mark form as complete (you can move through the instruments in REDCap by selecting “Save and Go to Next Form”
8. The Scales Survey Admin page is for if you want to skip certain scales (e.g., for time constraints), mark complete
    - Listed below are the scales administered for each timepoint, as of 4/20/2021 there is no pipeline for EF T2/T3 so you will have to manually de-select indicated scales (in red) under “Scales Survey Admin” on the left hand side and save
# will be updated

## Folder Preparation
Prepare the following paper copy printouts before the MRI Visit, all of the following documents can be found on Saturn (Saturn/Coordinators/Protocols/TED_PROTOCOLS/EXECUTIVE_829744/subjectfolder)
- Admin Folder: C2 Form, W9 Form, Clincard, CNB Notes Sheet (LiBI/Executive)
- MRI Folder: MRI Screener, MRI Session Record
