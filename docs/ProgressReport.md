# Progress Reports

Once a year, Principle Investigators are required to send updates to the NIMH on the progress of their studies. Coordinators are responsible for filling out recruitment updates and demographics tables. 

The recruitment update will include current numbers in each study group, and briefly discuss any major challenges the study has faced. 

The enrolment tables are found on saturn at the following path,  (afp://saturn/Coordinators/Protocols/TED_PROTOCOLS/EXECUTIVE_829744/EF Inclusion Enrollment Report), and look like this:

The easiest way to fill out each category is to use the demographics report in the EFR01 Data Entry #tracker project on RedCAP, filtering manually or using the coding language of your choice.
