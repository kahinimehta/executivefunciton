# Generating GUIDs for NDA Upload: 

GUID are Global Unique Identifiers used in the National Data Archive. In order to complete data sharing for NIMH, each study participant will need a GUID made. 

First, you will need to request an NDA account. Once you have logged in to your profile, click on the Tools menu, and select GUID tool.

If a subject has no middle name, leave the column blank and fill in NO for the column SUBJECTHASMIDDLENAME. 

If the document validates with no errors, generate GUIDS and save on Saturn. The GUIDs can be uploaded to Oracle, so that they auto populate in Tableau, or other data sources.
