# Recruitment
Participants will be recruited using screening mechanisms provided by LiBI (CHOP IRB  #16-013305), a research institute that spans both CHOP and Penn.   
- Target: 180 adolescents, including 65 with ADHD and 65 with PS, as well as 50 typically-developing comparators
- Patients will be drawn from two clinical groups with well-documented executive deficits: ADHD and PS.  Both patient groups and typically-developing comparators will be matched on age, sex, and race.

*Key Inclusion Criteria*:
- Age: 8-15
- Sex: Males and Females
- _Patients (n=130)_: 
     Each participant will meet diagnostic criteria for either ADHD or PS (see Assessment, below).  Given known and substantial co-morbidity between PS and ADHD (i.e., approx. 30% in the PNC), co-morbidity will be allowed and accounted for in specificity analyses. Youth meeting criteria for both PS and ADHD will be considered PS for enrollment purposes. 
- _Typically developing (n=50)_: 
     No current or lifetime history of any DSM-V diagnosis or substance use disorder.



*Key Exclusion Criteria*:
- Metallic implants, claustrophobia, or other contraindications to MRI
- Significant medical or neurological illness that impacts brain function or impedes participation
- Acute intoxication with alcohol or other substances based on clinical assessment or subject report. 
- Pregnancy
