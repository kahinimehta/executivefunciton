#### **1. Recruitment Call script**:

Hi, am I speaking with XX’s parent? My name is XX,  calling from the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. We would like to invite your XX to participate in a paid research study with us.  If you’re interested, do you have some time right now to talk about it? 
[No]
No worries. Would you mind explaining why this isn’t of interest to you? (Log in contact notes) Thank you for your time, have a nice day/night!
[Why my child?]
This was a randomly generated list from CHOP.
[Yes]
Our study examines how the brain changes and develops over time. It would be a two-part study. The first part involves an interview with 
[for participants aged 8-10] 
you
[for participants aged 11-15] 
you and your child
as well as some computerized games for your child. This part we’d be offering virtually so you could do it with a Zoom link from the comfort of your own home. The interview would take around 2-4 hours, depending on how much you’d be willing to share with us. The computerized games would take around 1.5 hours, and because we offer both online we’d be flexible with splitting up and [for participants aged 11-15] doing the interviews at the same time so it would take less overall time for your family. We’d be compensating $80 for this, payable via ClinCard, which is our version of a debit card, and you’d use it the exact same way. The second part of  the study would involve you and your child visiting the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania for an MRI scan. The entire visit would take 4-5 hours as it would also involve some more computerized games and self-reports about your child’s mood and experiences, but your child would only be in the scanner for one hour. You would be compensated $100 for this, and reimbursed for travel and parking via ClinCard. In 1.5 years, we’d follow up with you and have you come in for another scan day, but for right now, it’s just the interview, the computerized games, and the first MRI visit. Does this sound interesting? 
[No]
No worries. Would you mind explaining why this isn’t of interest to you? (Log in contact notes) Thank you for your time, have a nice day/night!
[Yes]
Thank you … [continue into next steps, see “Recruitment Call” section below]

#### **2. Voicemail template**: 

Hi, my name is XX from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Your child may be eligible to participate in a paid research study with us. Please give me a call or text back at +1 XX. Again, that’s +1 XX. Thank you. 

#### **3. Text template (tweak as needed)**: 

Hello XX ! This is XX from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Your child may be eligible to participate in a paid research study with us. If this is of interest to you, please let me know when you would have the availability for a call. 

#### **4. Recruitment Email Template (for potential parents)**: 

The Lifespan Brain Institute (LiBI) of CHOP and UPenn would like to invite you and your child to participate in a paid research study. Our LiBI researchers hope to learn more about how the brain grows and develops over time, and how those changes relate to the way that children think and solve problems. 
 
First, eligible participants will complete an interview, computer tasks, and a few questionnaires, which can be performed virtually or in person, depending on your preference. For children under age 18, a parent or guardian will also be interviewed. This visit usually lasts around 3 hours, and participants will be paid $80. 
 
After your interview, we will ask you and your child to come to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania for an MRI brain scan and some additional computer tasks. For this visit, participants will be paid $100, and will be reimbursed for any travel and parking expenses. This visit typically lasts around 4 hours. We will ask you and your child to complete these measures 2-3 times over the course of a 5-year longitudinal research study, in 18-month intervals.  
 
Here is the video cartoon of the research MRI if you would like to play it for your child to help them better understand the study! [https://www.chop.edu/video/getting-mri-cartoon-kids](https://www.chop.edu/video/getting-mri-cartoon-kids)
 
To inquire about your child’s eligibility to participate, or if you have additional questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at xxx-xxx-xxxx
 
All the best,
